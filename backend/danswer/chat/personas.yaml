# Currently in the UI, each Persona only has one prompt, which is why there are 3 very similar personas defined below.

personas:
  # This id field can be left blank for other default personas, however an id 0 persona must exist
  # this is for DanswerBot to use when tagged in a non-configured channel
  # Careful setting specific IDs, this won't autoincrement the next ID value for postgres
  - id: 0
    name: "Document Answer"
    description: >
      Assistant with access to documents from your Connected Sources.
    # Default Prompt objects attached to the persona, see prompts.yaml
    prompts:
      - "Answer-Question"
    # Default number of chunks to include as context, set to 0 to disable retrieval
    # Remove the field to set to the system default number of chunks/tokens to pass to Gen AI
    # Each chunk is 512 tokens long
    num_chunks: 10
    # Enable/Disable usage of the LLM chunk filter feature whereby each chunk is passed to the LLM to determine
    # if the chunk is useful or not towards the latest user query
    # This feature can be overriden for all personas via DISABLE_LLM_CHUNK_FILTER env variable
    llm_relevance_filter: true
    # Enable/Disable usage of the LLM to extract query time filters including source type and time range filters

    # Decay documents priority as they age, options are:
    # - favor_recent (2x base by default, configurable)
    # - base_decay
    # - no_decay
    # - auto (model chooses between favor_recent and base_decay based on user query)
    recency_bias: "auto"
    # Default Document Sets for this persona, specified as a list of names here.
    # If the document set by the name exists, it will be attached to the persona
    # If the document set by the name does not exist, it will be created as an empty document set with no connectors
    # The admin can then use the UI to add new connectors to the document set
    # Example:
    # document_sets:
    #   - "HR Resources"
    #   - "Engineer Onboarding"
    #   - "Benefits"
